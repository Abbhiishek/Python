   - Print statement not only print strings it can print any value stored in the variable for that :

Its appers that the whole 3 lines are in single block but they aree in different as they load with some time 

in line { print("print('what to print')") } we have used '' instead of "" as we can use both but we have to make sure that the opening and closing  quotation should be same , as in this line we want to print a ' ' so we used " " as opening and closing quotes  


alternatively we can use vice versa .......


Also , backslash n is used to have a line break and shift the afterward content to next line in the compiler !!!

We can combine two string in print statement using '+' e.g. print("Hello"+"World")

Doing this the word Hello World is printed as HelloWorld no spaces are there in between but we can make it happer 


1st approach :

------- >>> print("Hello "+"World")

- The first approach is to add a space after Hello within the quotation to make it in considerations

2nd approach :

------- >>> print("Hello"+"World ")

- The second approach is to add a space after World within the quotation to make it in considerations

3rd  approach :

------- >>> print("Hello" + " " + "World ")

- The third approach is to add a blank space within quotes around with + to combine three different Strings in one place to make it in considerations.
- In this case the whole thing is focused in the addon as the separter in nothing but a blank space added within a quotes.

Look at the code in the code editor on the right. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
Warning: The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

Example Output


When you run your program, it should print the following:

>>>Day 1 - String Manipulation
>>>String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
>>>e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
>>>New lines can be created with a backslash and n.

The Code that was given for the debugging is :

                print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
                print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
                   print{'e.g. print ("Hello " + "world")")
                print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

''')

print("      SOLUTIONS")
print('''

- There is a bunch of Errors that we need to fix as we have :
     1. in first line we have missed a " at the starting of the value
     2.In second line we have used the same " " for showing the + , that will not work as it will take that as code so we can use
     a second option which is a single quote ' ' 
     3. In line 3 we have Intendations error and also after print we have used a { which is not the way a function works so we have
     have to change that to ( and at the end of the line we have to use single quote to match the opening quote and not raise codded code block 
     4. In line 4 by mistake we have given double starting bracket at the start of print statement , we have to delete one 



- SO The Final code Looks Like :
                    print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
                    print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
                    print('e.g. print ("Hello " + "world")')
                    print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")


Let's have a look at the Output :

''')

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print ("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

There is most of time that you want to take a input from the user and then do something with that and give the output !

so How do we take Inputs from the user in python ?  

                            -> In python we do that by calling Input function
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Sytntax Goes like this :


                    input("The message on the behalf of which you want the Input from The user !")


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                   >PRINT VS INPUT<

    When we call the print function the job is to print the stuff and move to next line of code whereas , in case of Input 
    function the the stuff is simply printed like print function but in addtion to that it want a input from the user and 
    return that in the code and then move to next line of code .

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      Input () Function

                                                 input("A promot for the user") 

    Also , we can store the input from the user into some thing called variables(refer to variables.py)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                               Stored_input=input("HEY READER!")

    The code above actually take the input from the user on the behalf of the msg {HEY READER!} and send it to code and python store 
    that in the Variable called Stored_input

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                        print ("Hello " + input ("What is your name?"))

    The code above simply  print the String Hello  and then it moves to second part for sting Concatenation  , then it promot for the input from the user
    giving the meassge   -> What is your name? <-  the input from the user is replaced into  -> input ("What is your name?") <-  and then 
    sting Concatenation is done and finally the output is given by the print function

    >>>What is your name?Abhishek #Here Abhishek is the input from the user
    >>>Hello Abhishek ! #The Output we get from the coded code

- if we want a line in the code that to be avoided by the interpreter and will not be considered while running the program
  the Commenting Concept comes in ....

- If we use # in any line where some code is written then after the # all the things will be not considered

     print("hello" + #this is a comment)

    In this code after the # all the things will be considered as the comments and not to be considered while running
    as in the code the closing bracket is also after the # the code give the Error : SyntaxError

    - So its advised to use comments in new separate line or after the code is finished for that particular line .

- We have also a option of multi line commenting which comes handy when we have to comment a large content 
 
-  we can use """ {the content to 
          comments, supports multiline } """  , you can use single quote thrice also as now i am using that for 
          print statement (refer to printing.py), will give errors

=========================================================================================================================
                             So what's the practical use of the commenting ?

        1. actually comments are used to refer to the task that the code do 
        2. You can use that for you well wish.
        3. It can be used to Markdown something in the code , to make some notes , marking some code changes and so on ...

-afterward we will store the length in another variable and we will it print
Questions: how do we make it print: 
>>>>> print statement actually also allow to refer to any variable above it and we can use that variable and whenever we pass the variable 
      into the argument , the value stored in the varibale will be printed ! simple isn't !
