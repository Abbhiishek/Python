This is a print functions (predefined functions! )


print is the function name and inside the paranstes we pass the thing we want to print.


we have used " " to tell the system that its just a text that we have to print it's not hard coded code 

its have to be {STRINGS}

THE "" SHOULD HE OPENED AND CLOSED 

LIKE : print("this will not run and give error as we didn't close the value we want to pass )



SomeThing to Ponder:
   - Print statement not only print strings it can print any value stored in the variable for that :
      we just have to place that variable name in the brackets without quotation!


      cooool man !
