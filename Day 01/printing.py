its have to be {STRINGS}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can combine two string in print statement using '+' e.g. print("Hello"+"World")

Doing this the word Hello World is printed as HelloWorld no spaces are there in between but we can make it happer 


1st approach :

------- >>> print("Hello "+"World")

- The first approach is to add a space after Hello within the quotation to make it in considerations

2nd approach :

------- >>> print("Hello"+"World ")

- The second approach is to add a space after World within the quotation to make it in considerations

3rd  approach :

------- >>> print("Hello" + " " + "World ")

- The third approach is to add a blank space within quotes around with + to combine three different Strings in one place to make it in considerations.
- In this case the whole thing is focused in the addon as the separter in nothing but a blank space added within a quotes.
