#Indentations IN PYTHON 

print("Indentations IN PYTHON  ðŸ‘‡ ")

print('''

In python Programming language we have spaces and that's matter the most (also known as Indentations)

like if we start our print statement not from the start of a line  , rather after some spaces 

like 
   print("Hello World !")
- This is going to give us a error called : IndentationError!
- Indentation is one of the success key to have python !
