------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can combine two string in print statement using '+' e.g. print("Hello"+"World")

Doing this the word Hello World is printed as HelloWorld no spaces are there in between but we can make it happer 


1st approach :

------- >>> print("Hello "+"World")

- The first approach is to add a space after Hello within the quotation to make it in considerations

2nd approach :

------- >>> print("Hello"+"World ")

- The second approach is to add a space after World within the quotation to make it in considerations

3rd  approach :

------- >>> print("Hello" + " " + "World ")

- The third approach is to add a blank space within quotes around with + to combine three different Strings in one place to make it in considerations.
- In this case the whole thing is focused in the addon as the separter in nothing but a blank space added within a quotes.





SomeThing to Ponder:
   - Print statement not only print strings it can print any value stored in the variable for that :
      we just have to place that variable name in the brackets without quotation!


      cooool man !



                                             Code Intelligence ðŸ”»

Code Intelligence is used to auto complete the code , all text-editor have one of these

- It makes Coding quite easy and Joyful !  
- Its also indicate some error before running the code ( Awesome !)
-Its indicate by some red lines below the coded code .
