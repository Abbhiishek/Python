#                                   What i have learn't from this




print(
'''
What i have learn't from this :

Its appers that the whole 3 lines are in single block but they aree in different as they load with some time 

in line { print("print('what to print')") } we have used '' instead of "" as we can use both but we have to make sure that the opening and closing  quotation should be same , as in this line we want to print a ' ' so we used " " as opening and closing quotes  


alternatively we can use vice versa .......


Also , blackslash n is used to have a line break and shift the afterward content to next line in the compiler !!!
