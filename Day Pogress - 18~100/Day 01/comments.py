=========================================================================================================================


- if we want a line in the code that to be avoided by the interpreter and will not be considered while running the program
  the Commenting Concept comes in ....

- We just have to add a # in front of line to make that line comment

- If we use # in any line where some code is written then after the # all the things will be not considered 
  like : 
     print("hello" + #this is a comment)

    In this code after the # all the things will be considered as the comments and not to be considered while running
    as in the code the closing bracket is also after the # the code give the Error : SyntaxError

    - So its advised to use comments in new separate line or after the code is finished for that particular line .

- We have also a option of multi line commenting which comes handy when we have to comment a large content 
 
-  we can use """ {the content to 
          comments, supports multiline } """  , you can use single quote thrice also as now i am using that for 
          print statement (refer to printing.py), will give errors

                             So what's the practical use of the commenting ?

        1. actually comments are used to refer to the task that the code do 
        2. You can use that for you well wish.
        3. It can be used to Markdown something in the code , to make some notes , marking some code changes and so on ...
