There is most of time that you want to take a input from the user and then do something with that and give the output !

so How do we take Inputs from the user in python ?  

                            -> In python we do that by calling Input function
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Sytntax Goes like this :


                    input("The message on the behalf of which you want the Input from The user !")


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                   >PRINT VS INPUT<

    When we call the print function the job is to print the stuff and move to next line of code whereas , in case of Input 
    function the the stuff is simply printed like print function but in addtion to that it want a input from the user and 
    return that in the code and then move to next line of code .

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      Input () Function

                                                 input("A promot for the user") 

    Also , we can store the input from the user into some thing called variables(refer to variables.py)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                               Stored_input=input("HEY READER!")

    The code above actually take the input from the user on the behalf of the msg {HEY READER!} and send it to code and python store 
    that in the Variable called Stored_input

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                        print ("Hello " + input ("What is your name?"))

    The code above simply  print the String Hello  and then it moves to second part for sting Concatenation  , then it promot for the input from the user
    giving the meassge   -> What is your name? <-  the input from the user is replaced into  -> input ("What is your name?") <-  and then 
    sting Concatenation is done and finally the output is given by the print function

    >>>What is your name?Abhishek #Here Abhishek is the input from the user
    >>>Hello Abhishek ! #The Output we get from the coded code

""")
