Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

e.g. 86 is even because 86 ÷ 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is odd because 59 ÷ 2 = 29.5

29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

e.g.

6 ÷ 2 = 3 with no remainder.

therefore: 6 % 2 = 0

5 ÷ 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.

therefore: 5 % 2 = 1

14 ÷ 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.

therefore: 14 % 4 = 2

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Example Input 1
43
Example Output 1
This is an odd number.
Example Input 2
94
Example Output 2
This is an even number.

if number%2==0:

Lets check the program
